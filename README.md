### Bubble Sort
* Best Case - O(n): They're all sorted.
  * The number of passes depends on the size of the ArrayList; if the size is n, the number of passes is n - 1. 

* Worst Case - O(n^2): They're in reverse order.


### Selection Sort
* Best Case: None

* Worst Case: None

 * Therefore time complexity will always be O(n^2)

### Insertion Sort
* Best case - O(n): They're all sorted.
  * No swaps will be done and fewer comparisons will be made.
  * For sorted array of 5:
```
The number of comparisons is 4.
The number of swaps made is 0.
The number of passes is 4.
```
* Worst Case - O(n^2): In reverse order.
